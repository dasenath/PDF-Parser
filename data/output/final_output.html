Under Article 28(1) of the TPD, the Commission must submit a report on the Directive\'s application<sup>2</sup> by 20 May 2021. The report must discuss, specifically, the elements of the Directive that should be reviewed given scientific and technical developments, including internationally agreed rules and standards on tobacco and related products. The TPD has aimed to reduce tobacco consumption by 2% within five years of its transposition<sup>3</sup>. Based on the latest Eurobarometer<sup>4</sup>, smoking prevalence among those aged 15+ fell from 26% in 2014 to 23% in 2020 - a drop<sup>5</sup> of 3 percentage points since the TPD came into force, equivalent to 12.5%. Youth smoking rates fell to 20% in 2020 from 25% in 2014, after peaking at 29% in 2017. However, the uptake of emerging products, especially e-cigarettes, is growing among young people<sup>6</sup>. This is worrying given the aim to protect the youth.",

At EU level, the 2021 Europe\'s Beating Cancer Plan places tobacco control at the spotlight of disease prevention efforts to help achieve a tobacco- free Europe by 2040. The intermediate objective is to reach the WHO target of a 30% relative reduction in tobacco use by 2025 as compared to 2010<sup>7</sup>, translating into an EU smoking prevalence rate of around 20% by 2025 compared to 29% in 2010.

      text: "19 Within the FCTC, the Working Group on Articles 9&10 (Regulation of the contents and disclosures of tobacco products) in which the EU is a key facilitator, looked at the methods. Such methods were also further developed by the WHO Tobacco Laboratory Network (TobLabNet). However, there has been no consensus among the FCTC Parties to approve any of the emission measurement methods for inclusion into the relevant FCTC guidelines. 20 For TNCO measurement, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 3308) smoking regime (puff volume 35 mL, puff duration 2s, puff interval 60s) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regime (puff volume 55 mL, puff duration 2s, puff interval 30s) are the two approaches usually applied. Due to the different parameters used, higher quantities of tar, nicotine and CO are systematically measured in the HCI regime (with 110ml of puff volume captured per minute) compared to the ISO method (with 35ml of puff volume captured per minute). 21 One of the elements influencing the real individual exposure of smokers is filter ventilation, a technical feature designed to dilute the inhaled smoke. This is because smokers, when smoking their cigarette, usually cover some of ventilation holes. In order to improve transparency about the characteristics of products on the EU-market, manufacturers and importers are required to report a set of cigarette-specific parameters which should be considered in conjunction with emission measurements when interpreting them: the total ventilation of the filter (0-100%), the drop of pressure with closed vents (mmH2O) and the drop of pressure with open vents (mmH2O). These data are available to the Member States for such analysis and should provide for unbiased product assessment without a need to modify the current TPD reference to the ISO methods. 22 https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/tobacco/docs/approved_laboratories_en.pdf 23 So far, over 5 500 economic operators applied for a submitter ID. Almost 2400 submitted their products (over 42 000 tobacco and 300 000 e-cigarettes are active in EU-CEG at the moment). 24 This Joint Action (http://jaotc.eu/) brought 25 Member States together to help implement the TPD; with a cost of EUR 2.5 m (the EU contributed 80%).",

These Member States notified these measures to the Commission, along with the grounds for introducing them, justified by public health considerations and they also proved that these measures are proportionate and do not constitute means of arbitrary discrimination. Based on evidence<sup>15</sup> from Member States, plain packaging along with pictorial warnings appear to increase awareness of tobacco related-diseases and associated illnesses, and the motivation to quit, and help to reduce smoking, including among young people. About half of Europeans are in favour of introducing \'plain packaging\' for cigarettes<sup>4</sup>. These measures align with international developments, as plain packaging is the golden standard promoted by the WHO and the FCTC, and has been upheld as consistent with international trade law in a landmark WTO ruling<sup>37</sup>. Stricter regulation through plain packaging also helps with implementing product presentation provisions, namely a full ban on promotional elements. However, the introduction of plain packaging requirements only in some Member States can be an obstacle to free movement of goods. Moreover, formats of standardised packaging may differ between Member States, additionally distorting the internal market\'s smooth functioning.",

For users of electronic cigarettes, they found moderate weight of evidence for risks of local irritative damage to the respiratory tract and moderate, but a growing level of evidence from human data suggesting that electronic cigarettes have harmful health effects, especially but not limited to the cardiovascular system. More so, they found weak to moderate weight of evidence for risks of carcinogenicity of the respiratory tract due to long-term, cumulative exposure to nitrosamines and due to exposure to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde and concluded that weight of evidence for risk of poisoning and injuries due to burns and explosion is strong. They also found weak to moderate weight of evidence for several risks related to second-hand exposure. Overall, there is moderate evidence that electronic cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people and strong evidence that flavours have a relevant contribution for attractiveness of use of electronic cigarette and initiation.

On implementing provisions on slim cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and cigarillos, different experiences have been reported. Most Member States do not mandate pictorial warnings for cigarillos, often targeted at cigarette users with their lower price or features banned in cigarettes, e.g. flavour capsules. Waterpipe tobacco use frequently takes place in specific premises, e.g. shisha lounges, where consumers do not see health warning labels and pictorials. Another concern over waterpipe tobacco, as for cigarillos, is the use of flavours and their attractiveness to youths.",

A justification for the TPD was that the disparities in labelling of tobacco products were a barrier to the internal market (Recitals 22 and 23), and indeed harmonising labelling and packaging rules was a key success of the TPD, chiefly because it harmonised packaging across the internal market. There were few issues related to Art. 8, 10, and 11, with some minor confusions identified and resolved early on. However, there were a few issues, for example Art. 9(3) was ambiguous about whether or not it was meant to prohibit \'slim\' packets of cigarettes, or questions were raised about packets with bevelled edges.",

The TPD has created consistency in areas that were not previously harmonised, although some areas lacking harmony impacted the internal market. Additional minor areas included the use of broad terms in Art. 13 to cover a range of promotional packaging and products (lacking specific indications on phrasing permitted or prohibited and creating difficulties with application), divergent national approaches, and legal challenges in several Member States. The TPD leaves certain provisions to Member State discretion. While this can be beneficial to public health by allowing Member States to go beyond the TPD requirements, it can also affect harmonisation. For example, Art. 11 permits Member States to exempt certain products from labelling requirements. This has created inconsistent packaging across Member States, and harmonisation would be improved if there were no such opportunities for exemptions.",

Art. 15 of the TPD includes measures on traceability of tobacco products, and Art. 16 includes measures on security features, which stakeholders stated would strongly limit the possibility of introducing illicit products. However, it is still too early to assess the exact impact of the systems of tobacco traceability and security features on illicit products in the EU as they have been in place for too short a time. There are some concerns that certain aspects of the traceability system may not be optimal for combating illicit trade in the EU. Examples of potential issues that could hinder the overall ability to address illicit trade include the shared responsibility for the traceability system between multiple national administrative bodies, the complexity of the traceability system, and the capacity and resources required to comply with the system.",

However, variation between Member States still remains, such as e-cigarette flavours and plain packaging.

The health warning labels, and other labelling and packaging measures introduced through Art. 8-14 of the TPD have been identified as especially relevant to changing perceptions and use of tobacco products, particularly among young people. However, Member States, independent civil society organisations (CSOs) and health experts (HEs) were particularly concerned about the increasing use of e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products (HTPs) and other emerging products by young people. There is some concern that the current scope of the TPD may be inappropriate for products other than cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco (e.g. packaging and labelling requirements, and characterising flavours). More evidence will be needed to determine how the TPD can remain relevant to addressing the issue of smoking in the EU, particularly among young people and specific vulnerable populations, and in relation to e-cigarettes, HTPs and novel tobacco products. There are also potential issues with the TPD\'s ability to safeguard young people from accessing tobacco and related products when they are under the legal age, which is not within its scope. The mystery shopping exercise undertaken as part of this study revealed frequent insufficient age verification processes for tobacco and related products bought online through CBDS.",

New product categories have emerged that circumvent existing regulations such that they cannot be completely addressed by existing provisions in the TPD.

This is particularly true in respect of the better functioning of the internal market and better coordination between Member States. These are objectives that, by definition, can only be achieved through action at EU level. There is reason to believe that a degree of public health protection similar to that provided by the TPD would not have been achieved by Member States acting alone. The political willingness to enact strict tobacco control measures can vary between Member States, sometimes to a considerable extent. Action at the EU level helped to mainstream the level of protection for all EU citizens and residents, and helped certain Member States to overcome domestic political opposition. Action at EU level also helped Member States wishing to enact stricter tobacco control measures but who were rebutted by tobacco companies\' opposition and/or threat of legal challenges. Finally, there is an inherent value in having one overarching piece of legislation regulating tobacco and related products in terms of coherence and effectiveness of tobacco control.",

The 2020 wave includes several new questions on Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs) and herbal products and allowed for a more robust trend analysis of prevalence and frequency of smoking and use of tobacco related products. The indicators available from the Euromonitor International were mapped to our assessment objectives and the three specific types of analysis we undertook: market share, assessing consumer views and behaviours, and assessing substantial change in circumstances<sup>16</sup>.

There is also ambiguity concerning which products may fall out of the scope of the Directive (e.g. devices for HTPs, some nicotine products not containing tobacco, etc.), to which stakeholders still consider requiring an EU harmonised approach regulation. In addition, there is a need for new or revised definitions, including of terms and concepts used in the Directive, for example \'combustion\', as these terms risk being interpreted differently across the Member States.

      text: "Nine Member States reportedly faced issues with the definition of tobacco for oral use, mostly due to technical difficulties in differentiating it from chewing tobacco as a result of its similar presentation (around a third of Member States) which led to enforcement challenges. A few Member States highlighted that producers had circumvented the rules and commercialised tobacco for oral use products as chewing tobacco. This was also observed by CSO stakeholders in a few Member States. For example, in a few Member States products very similar to tobacco for oral use (snus) were presented on the packaging as chewing tobacco. For this reason, a few Member States have additionally prohibited chewing and / or nasal tobacco products in their national laws. A few Member States mentioned there was a lack of technical criteria to differentiate both type of products and one Member State specified there was no recommended laboratory method to determine the type of product. Others were investigating a laboratory method to differentiate the products. To address this situation, a few CSO stakeholders, a few HEs, and Member States called for a reassessment of the definitions of chewing tobacco and tobacco for oral use to prevent these circumvention efforts.",

One Member State called for a revision of the term \'cigarette\' to also include herbal products. According to the authorities \'this makes some problems to regulate some products\'. In the TPD, it is forbidden to sell unit packets of cigarettes that contain less than 20 cigarettes. Cigarettes are defined as \'rolls of tobacco\'. Therefore, since herbal products presented as cigarettes do not contain tobacco, the sale of packages of less than 20 units is not restricted by the TPD. This is a challenge because herbal products become cheaper and more available to young people.",

The influence of the industry on the ISO standard for measuring TNCO was seen by a few Member States as potentially in conflict with Art.5(3) of the FCTC<sup>37</sup>, which states that Parties shall act to protect public health policies related to tobacco control from \'commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry\'. A few Member States reported that this industry involvement was questionable or inappropriate, and a few others considered that measurement methods which are developed independently from the industry should be used instead. A request for a preliminary ruling from the Rechtbank Rotterdam (NL) was lodged on 24 March 2020 with the ECJ<sup>38</sup>. This case questions the independence and transparency of the ISO method in Art. 4(1), and questions if it is aligned with Art. 297(1) TFEU (and Regulation (EU) No 216/2013) and with the underlying principle of transparency.",

This means that while previously Member States had the option to approve and monitor laboratories which were run by economic operators, now they have to identify and approve other laboratories. In practice this means that there is less oversight on the quality of the laboratories being used by economic operators to measure their products. The 2001 TPD mandated the labelling of TNCO levels on products. One CSO noted that another unintended consequence of this was the misrepresentation of health risks in certain brands. However, now that this information has been removed from packaging in the present iteration of the TPD, TNCO levels are only entered into EU-CEG, and are not widely provided to consumers. Therefore, the added value of these laboratories and measurements is only to determine if a product is above or below the TNCO limits, with the measurement itself not having as much bearing.",

These exemptions shall be withdrawn for a particular product category if there is established a substantial change of circumstances.

For example, they raised concerns about the growing market for waterpipe tobacco and alternative ways emerging to flavour products, e.g. with menthol capsules/strings<sup>118</sup>.

The Court analysed in depth the issue of flavouring - concluded that since tobacco products having a characterising flavour facilitate initiation of tobacco consumption and affect consumption patterns, that prohibition is liable to make them less attractive and meets objectives of general interest recognised by the EU, by contributing to ensuring a high level of protection of public health and does not go beyond that. especially of young people.

Member States noted that to enforce such a prohibition they have to prove that an additive is in the product.

One Member State suggested splitting/co-ordinating each ingredient focus across Member States. Along the same lines, there was also mention of a lack of resources and laboratories, and time or difficulty to review product data submitted through the system.

Based on evidence from multiple Member States, these interventions appear to significantly increase knowledge of tobacco-related diseases and associated harms and motivation to quit, and they may even reduce tobacco consumption and youth smoking initiation<sup>135,136,137,138,139</sup>. Data from 10 European countries (BE, DE, DK, ES, FR, IT, PL, RO, SE and UK) suggests that the effectiveness of pictorial warnings may decrease over time but can be mitigated by the periodic inclusion of new pictures, as specified in Art. 10(2) of the TPD<sup>140</sup>. A recent study from the EUREST-PLUS consortium<sup>141</sup> found that after the introduction of the combined health warnings due to Art. 10, adult smokers in six Member States (DE, EL, HU, PL, RO, ES) reported that these had increased salience, in that they noticed the warning labels on cigarette packages or roll-your-own tobacco packets more often. However, there were no clear trends for cognitive reactions (in response to \'To what extent do the warning labels make you think about the health risks of smoking?\' and \'To what extent do the warning labels on cigarette packs make you more likely to quit smoking?\') or behavioural reactions (\'In the last 30 days, have the warning labels stopped you from having a cigarette when you were about to smoke one?\'). Another study from the same research group<sup>142</sup> found that among adult smokers and recent quitters in the same six Member States, over half of smokers and around a third of quitters noticed at least one of five TPD-related packet changes. Over one-quarter of all respondents noticed changes to health warnings, standardized openings, minimum packet unit size, and the removal of TNCO information on packaging. These results varied across countries and demographics of study participants.",

One Member State considered that the exemption constituted a disadvantage, as these products may now be perceived as more attractive or less harmful by consumers. Another noted that the exemption in Art. 11 was made because of high pressure from the tobacco industry; there were no health advantages to this decision. One economic operator described how industry had lobbied in Member States to enact the exemption for cigar and cigarillo, as the packaging was reportedly too small to fit the default warnings. One Member State reported exemptions for some large cigars. As these products are not popular among children, this was a compromise between political parties when implementing the TPD.",

Another Member State reported that implementing plain packaging simplified confusions about product presentation for cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, as there was less ambiguity. In France, there was a regulation banning any products which promote tobacco consumption, to avoid diversion of plain packaging legislation and to reduce the attractiveness of packaging of products which do not have plain packaging. However, this regulation was challenged at the High Administrative Court, which then sent a preliminary ruling to the ECJ. The ban was subsequently suspended<sup>157</sup>.

When plain packaging and minimum packet sizes of 20 cigarettes or 30 g of roll-your-own tobacco (required by Art. 14 TPD) were introduced, cigarette smokers were more likely to purchase lower-price cigarettes. However, the results of this study may be confounded with the introduction of plain packaging around the same time as the minimum pack size, therefore the effect of pack size cannot be isolated. Surveys associated with this study identified price as the main driver of purchasing. In a previously mentioned study from the EUREST-PLUS consortium<sup>160</sup>, over one-quarter of all respondents noticed changes to minimum packet unit size due to the TPD, although these results varied across countries and demographics of study participants.",

While product display is beyond the remit of the TPD, it is important to note tactics such as this which reduce the efficacy of the provisions on labelling and packaging. Secondly, a few CSOs and one HE stated that CBDS instantly reduce the efficacy of the warnings, as health warnings and cessation service information is likely in another language. Further, a few CSOs and one HE stated that the tobacco industry had invested in innovative methods to make packaging more appealing. Some of these methods include the introduction of bevelled or rounded edges on cigarette packets, seals, multipack outers, hand rolled tobacco accessories, cigars, and pipe tobacco.",

Another Member State highlighted that problems with illicit trade persisted with bordering (non-EU) countries, which are home of large producers of cigarettes for the EU\'s illegal market. Another Member State highlighted that illegal factories established in the EU territory using raw tobacco and machinery, represented the main source of illicit trade.

For those respondents that did so, there has been a two- percentage point increase in those respondents that have tried oral, chewing or nasal tobacco (7%), compared to the proportions in March 2017 (5%). Despite these percentage increases, there is very low proportion of respondents that have used oral chewing and nasal tobacco in the EU, and those who report having used these products say that they do so infrequently. Country differences are shown in Figure 4, presenting few changes have been reported over time in the country level proportions of those who have used these products. Experience of oral, chewing, or nasal tobacco has increased since March 2017, particularly in Ireland (+13pp) and Estonia (+8 pp). By age group, those respondents aged 25-30 represent the highest proportion of users of oral, chewing or nasal tobacco products (10%), compared to 7% in March 2017.

Some stakeholders described a \'lack of proper rules\' for novel tobacco products (), which most () consider to be due to the fact that such products were very new at the time of the adoption of the TPD, and there have been many products adopted since. For example, devices used in the consumption of the novel tobacco product, but that are not connected to tobacco itself, are not clearly regulated, and Member States considered this a loophole in current EU legislation. Nonetheless, the TPD does not prevent Member States from regulating the devices at national level.",

A few economic operators mentioned that the existing authorisation systems for novel tobacco products facilitated dialogue and enabled Member States to ask for any new or updated information on the studies and updates on scientific developments. However, another economic operator mentioned that an authorisation system and requirements for placement on the market, should be grounded on independent expert assessment, internationally recognised standards and based on the local needs to tackle the evolution of the local novel tobacco products\' market. One economic operator mentioned that in those Member States which had put in place an authorisation system and respective procedure, the requirements were generally harmonised. Further, the same economic operator mentioned that the management of post-authorisation updates was complex, and the rules were not always clearly defined.",

Their characteristics are provided in Table 9 below; all five had more than 1000 employees and operated in nearly all Member States. Four of these operators commercialise cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco as well, therefore their main area of business is likely to be tobacco products. No economic operators independent of the large tobacco companies were involved, which is a limitation of the available data as their experience, aims, and views are likely to differ from those of bigger organisations.

The desk review indicated that there has been EU-level guidance from the DG SANTE sub-group on e-cigarettes on how the TPD applies to e-cigarettes, in particular around the rapidly developing e-cigarette market and how this intersects with the transposition and enforcement of Art. 20 of the TPD. For example, in a 2019 DG SANTE meeting of the sub-group on e-cigarettes, it was reported that there would be a checklist to support e-cigarette compliance with the TPD, covering areas, such as labelling, packaging, combined health warnings, unit packets and ingredients. Member States that participated in this meeting also exchanged views on emerging market trends around e-cigarettes, including trends around the use of cannabidiol and cannabinoid liquids, e-liquids without nicotine and enforcement of e-cigarette measures with respect to internet sales<sup>211</sup>. Many (64%) economic operators in the online survey responded that the guidance received on e- cigarettes was clear and useful \'to some extent\'.",

However, this initiative did not reach the required threshold of signatures. Art. 20 was also contested in UK courts<sup>213</sup>, where its validity was brought into question with respect to the restrictions on e-cigarettes as a distinct category from traditional cigarettes. Similarly, some stakeholders (one CSO, one HE, a few organisations representing consumers) disagreed with the inclusion of e-cigarettes in the TPD, as they opined that the Directive was meant to regulate tobacco products only. A few HEs stated that including e-cigarettes in the TPD failed to acknowledge the important differences between tobacco products and e-cigarettes; and combining them could cause confusion between HTPs and e-cigarettes, despite them being very different products.",

On this point, recital 47 states that the TPD does not harmonise all aspects of electronic cigarettes or refill containers and that the responsibility for adopting rules on flavours remains with the Member States. At present, Finland, Estonia and Hungary have fully implemented bans on e-cigarette flavours, and additional Member States are considering or implementing bans. One CSO urged a drastic reduction in the number of permitted flavours and additives in e-cigarettes in order to better protect public health, especially to reduce youth use. Another recommended prohibiting flavours in all e-cigarette liquids across the EU.

More than three quarters (76%) say they gave up smoking - or attempted to give up smoking - without using any cessation aid. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, smoking cessation is an increasingly common reason reported for using e-cigarettes in Europe<sup>234</sup>. In the Eurobarometer survey<sup>235</sup>, the most common reason for starting use of e-cigarettes was to stop or reduce tobacco consumption (58% of those who use or used e-cigarettes), although this fell by 3 percentage between 2017 and 2020. Focus group participants in the consumer preference and perception study<sup>236</sup> identified e-cigarettes as an aid to reduce or quit another tobacco product, and current and former users, responding to the study\'s survey, often cited stopping or reducing consumption of another tobacco product as a reason for starting to use e-cigarettes. By Member State, the recent EUREST-PLUS study showed that e-cigarettes were the most widely used smoking cessation aid in England (51.7% of respondents who reported making a quit attempt in previous 12 months), Greece (26.3%) and Germany (15.0%)<sup>237</sup>.

Studies of the content of e-liquids have reported mixed findings regarding compliance with TPD requirements set out in Art. 20(3) and Art. 20(4). In a study investigating the content of the most popular brands of e-cigarette refill liquids in 9 Member States (FR, PL, DE, NL, UK, ES, RO, HU, EL), purchased before and after the implementation of the TPD (2016 and 2018), over half the products were found to have a discrepancy in nicotine concentration that was over 10% of that indicated by the product label (a threshold set by the European Commission\'s Joint Research Centre). Whether the products were purchased before or after TPD implementation did not appear to be associated with the level of discrepancy between the measured and reported nicotine content; 53.7% of products were above the threshold of 10% discrepancy after the TPD had been implemented, compared to 57.6% of products before the TPD<sup>334</sup>. However, only one product from the post-TPD samples was found to have a nicotine concentration exceeding the 20mg/ml legislated limit, compared to eight of the pre-TPD implementation samples. Another study focused on e-cigarette refills available in Belgium from 2013 to 2018 found that labelling discrepancies regarding nicotine content have decreased over the period of TPD implementation, as has the number of products containing high-risk volatile organic compounds, caffeine, and the flavourings diacetyl and acetyl propionyl<sup>335</sup>. In the present study, a HE reported that potentially hazardous substances have been found in e-cigarettes, and several stakeholders (one CSO and one HE) urged stronger monitoring of e-cigarette additives.",

In a related question, around a fifth (19%) of CSO and HE respondents said the TPD \'somewhat\' sufficiently addresses new developments related to herbal products, although a large percentage (44%) said they did not know. Economic operators who responded to the online survey were largely split about the TPD\'s ability to address new developments in this area: around 10% of them said \'a great deal\', \'somewhat\', \'a little\', and \'not at all\' to this item, and over half of them (56%) said they did not know. Some stakeholders (a few CSOs and one HE) recommended that as the market was changing quickly the TPD may need to adapt to these newer products, such as CBD products. For example, regarding CBD products, one Member State suggested that it should be allowed to ask for a proof of the THC percentage.",

The changes of flavour names (banned by Art. 13 of the Directive) to colour names is one example, a strategy that has been pointed out as being misleading in the communication of relative harms of tobacco products.

Studies suggest that plain packaging reduces the appeal of packs, increases awareness of health-warning labels (which depict tobacco harms and diseases) and the motivation to quit, and also helps contribute to a reduction of smoking prevalence. Most plain packaging legislation was adopted too recently to allow for a conclusive analysis of its impact. However, there are some indications that it has decreased youth smoking rates to some degree in two Member States. HEs and CSOs consider that plain packaging was a great success of the Directive (albeit not being required by the Directive) and a number of CSOs suggested that plain packaging should be made mandatory in all Member States.",

While all members agreed that Art. 7(6) applied from 20 May 2016, there was debate on the extent to which the transitional period applied to provisions not directly linked to the presence of certain characterising flavours. For example, some favoured full application of such requirements from May 2016, while others were unsure whether this would be in line with the legal text.

Most Member States, as well as a few CSOs and HEs operating across several Member States, agreed that the TPD had improved the functioning of the internal market, at least to some extent<sup>409</sup>. Key examples of facilitating that functioning included the harmonisation of rules on packaging (Art. 8- 14), larger combined health warnings (Art. 8-14), reporting and regulation of ingredients, EU-CEG common reporting system (Art. 5), and novel tobacco products (Art. 19). Fewer economic operators than Member States agreed that the TPD had improved the functioning of the internal market, at least to some extent.

Similarly, at the 2015 meeting of the Group of Experts on Tobacco Policy<sup>414</sup>, clarity was sought by Member States on how health warnings should be printed on cigarette packaging with bevelled or rounded edges (related to Recital 28), with Group members agreeing that warnings should not be printed across bevelled or rounded edges. DG SANTE clarified to Member States how bevelled or rounded edges should be considered in area calculations and that the warning should not be printed on those edges. Due to its importance and the difficulties caused, it may be beneficial to clarify this point within the main body of the Directive, rather than in the recitals (see Tier 1 section on Art. 8-14 for further information).",

There was a 2pp increase in respondents that had tried oral, chewing or nasal tobacco (7%), compared to 2017 (5%). The largest increases occurred in Ireland (+13pp) and Estonia (+8pp). As the only country where tobacco for oral use is legal, Sweden unsurprisingly had much higher rates of having tried oral, chewing, or nasal tobacco than other Member States (46%). However, this share had dropped by 4pp since 2017 (50%).",

However, these systems have not been in place long enough to evaluate their effectiveness. Additionally, cross-border flows of non-compliant products, between EU countries and bordering non-EU countries and between bordering EU countries, have continued under the TPD.  The TPD has demonstrated relevance to Member State harmonisation by effectively setting a minimum standard for health warning labels, packaging formats, maximum emission levels, characterising flavours for cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, certain ingredients and additives, traceability and security features. The flexibility the TPD in permitting Member States to go beyond some of the regulations maintains its relevance. Where Member States have used this flexibility, they provide an example that others can follow, resulting in other Member States implementing new policies.  The need to address the use of tobacco products by young people has been addressed by the TPD, but has not been as relevant in relation to e-cigarettes and other novel tobacco products, with greater uptake of these products among those aged under 25 years since the implementation of the TPD. Additionally, as CBDS are still permitted under the TPD but the method of age-verification is not strictly regulated, this remains an access route to these products for those under the legal age in each Member State.",

More specifically, Denmark is currently in the process of implementing a ban, legislation including a ban is due to be considered in Lithuania during 2021, and the Netherlands has opened consultation on potential legislation around e-cigarette flavours. However, Member States that have implemented e-cigarette flavour bans have faced substantial challenges, particularly with companies selling liquids that can be used in e-cigarettes at times circumventing bans by portraying them as foodstuffs. Additionally, Member States have limited capacity to keep up with the large number of e-cigarettes notified to them.

For instance, there is some evidence that e-cigarette flavours are important for attracting users<sup>460,461,462</sup>, and limited evidence that they might also be important in switching from combustible tobacco products to e-cigarettes<sup>463,464,465</sup>.

This highlights an important gap in tobacco control where young people could be better protected from the harms associated with tobacco and related products.",

This may be indicative of a displacement effect or attempts to circumvent the ban on characterising flavours. It should be noted that even though they are exempt from the EU ban on characterising flavours, sales of cigars and cigarillos have been steadily decreasing for the past decade (falling from 10.76 to 8.97 billion pieces since the introduction of the TPD). The trend needs to be further reassessed following the full menthol ban application. There are concerns that the absence of a ban on characterising flavours for all tobacco and related products may simply lead to a change in which products are consumed (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2.1, and Annex 9 for the e-cigarette flavourings case study), rather than a reduction in overall use of tobacco and related products.",

In particular, devices used in HTPs are not clearly captured by the TPD, although some Member States have separate regulating legislation<sup>476</sup>. Herbal products present a similar challenge, with some Member States reporting devices for heating or \'vaporising\' these products appearing on the market, and some products being designed for \'heating\' rather than smoking<sup>477</sup>. The herbal product market raises an additional challenge due to the increase in products containing THC or CBD, as these psychoactive substances are not explicitly addressed by the TPD<sup>478</sup>. Some Member States were unsure whether such products should be considered herbal products or treated as a different product type, and how this related to EU legislation on illicit drugs<sup>479</sup>. There is some discussion in the research literature as to whether some herbal products derived from cannabis should be regulated as foodstuffs and harmonised under EU law<sup>480</sup>.",

Data from Euromonitor International suggests that the upward trend in the market value of non-traditional tobacco and nicotine products is continuing - over the period 2013-2019, the retail value of the entirety of the tobacco market increased by approximately EUR13 billion, of which EUR4 billion was growth in e-cigarettes and EUR3 billion in HTPs. Overall, the growth of these products accounted for 52% of the growth of the retail value of the total market over the period 2013-2019. This is an important development as although non-traditional nicotine and tobacco products only account for a relatively small portion of the total value of the tobacco market, they have been responsible for most of its growth in recent years. Data from Euromonitor International indicates that the market size for e- cigarettes was estimated to be almost EUR6 billion in 25 EU Member States<sup>487</sup> in 2019, having experienced an overall growth rate of 237% between 2013-2019. In comparison the retail value of cigarettes increased by 2% (from EUR122 billion to EUR125 billion) and retail volume decreased by 11% (approximately 510 to 450 billion sticks). This growth led to the overall share of e-cigarettes in the tobacco market increasing from 1% in 2013 to 4% in 2019. Although e-cigarettes and HTPs represent a small proportion of the overall tobacco market, it is an area of substantial expansion and diversification and this appears likely to continue. It has been challenging for TPD provisions to remain relevant to this part of the market.",

Overall, costs are likely to be underestimated, as the study did not collect data from all relevant public agencies and not all responding Member States were able to submit cost data for all questions. Member States in general found that reviewing the information submitted to the EU-CEG system created high administrative and technical burdens. Member States described issues in processing and assessing submitted products information, and problems were often related to a lack of capacity to analyse submissions (reported in 11 Member States). For example, in one Member State, only certain limited staff members were dedicated to processing and assessing the information, and they have limited time and opportunities to train others to carry out such checks.",

The implementation of traceability and the introduction of security features also had to be established, which meant numerous coordination meetings with the European Commission, competent authorities and with other stakeholders, including the provider of the secondary repository are necessary. It also required identification and instalment of a national ID issuer and its transformation into national law, development of a software tool (app for smartphones) for controls to ensure the review of marketable products on the market, new contracts between industry and independent parties, new kinds of control administration, more interdisciplinary communication between stakeholders, and reporting obligations. In another Member State, the obligation of notification for e-cigarettes generated a substantial amount of work, with eight people working full-time on these notifications.",

This was partially related to Member State authorities lacking capacity to properly assess, process, and react to the large volume of submissions, which also hindered the application of Art. 6, 19 and 20. However, improvements could be made to the technological system itself, and an EU-wide database containing information about products could potentially increase communication and reduce workload among NCAs. Another example is that Member States may not have fully applied the provisions on TNCO laboratories, as they lacked resources to appoint approved labs which would be independent from industry (Art. 4).",

A standardised financial costs template gathered information on (1) packaging and labelling, and (2) ingredients and emissions in relation to e-cigarettes and tobacco products. In total, eight organisations completed the template for tobacco products, while just one responded for e-cigarettes. Due to the limited sample size for the latter, the assessment drew only on the data gathered for tobacco products. The number of products for which labelling and packaging changed due to TPD requirements ranged from 146 to 4,000 among the respondents.",

The study assumed that a 1% reduction in the number of smokers would lead to a 0.5% reduction in predicted mortality, morbidity and costs of smoking by the year 2027.

This trend appears to roughly confirm the baseline forecasted in the support study for the TPD impact assessment, although it is not possible to make any reliable comparisons, given the different data sources used. The same Eurobarometer shows a 2pp decline in smoking prevalence between 2020 and 2017 in the EU-27, which, with an annual average of 0.67pp per year, is slightly higher than the baseline trend, and which may potentially be attributed to the TPD (which was expected to be applied in practice in the Member States by May 2016, with transitional provisions up to May 2017 for some products). Using the same assumptions as the support study for the TPD impact assessment, this difference of 2% should thus result to a 1% reduction in predicted mortality, morbidity and costs of smoking by the year 2033.",

However, the SMEs that responded to the economic stakeholders\' survey<sup>501 </sup>were largely negative about the additional supports and flexibility of Member State authorities in relation to the new TPD requirements. More than half (56%) considered that the TPD did not allow for sufficient flexibility for SMEs and pointed out that the implementation of the TPD was overly complex and costly for SMEs, while favouring large cigarette companies. General comments highlighted that the characteristics of mid-sized and smaller companies were ignored by the TPD. A large share (74%) were not aware of any specific supports for SMEs (Table 32).

The WHO FCTC specifies that Parties shall - in setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control - protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry (Art. 5(3) FCTC). However, the traceability measures in Art. 15 of the TPD requires the tobacco industry to carry out certain tasks, which was perceived by some stakeholders (mainly CSOs) to be incoherent. For instance, Art. 15(8) specifies that manufacturers and importers of tobacco products will \'conclude data storage contracts with an independent third party\' and that these third parties will be monitored by an \'external auditor, who is proposed and paid by the tobacco manufacturer,\' although these auditors also need to be approved by the European Commission. This perceived incoherence was mentioned by a small number of Member States (although not all Member States have ratified the WHO FCTC Protocol on Illicit Trade) and a large number of CSO and HE survey respondents<sup>527</sup>. However, despite these concerns (see Tier 1 assessment of Art. 15 and 16), many Member States also felt that there was sufficient independence of traceability and security features measures from the tobacco industry<sup>528</sup>, and a chapter in a World Bank review listed a series of measures aimed at protecting the traceability system from vested interests<sup>529</sup>.",

Art. 4(1) of the TPD specifies that ISO standards will be used for measuring emissions. ISO standards have (potentially) not kept pace with scientific evidence and best practice in measuring emissions, which several CSOs and HEs perceived as a potential failure to adhere to the WHO FCTC. Several stakeholders from NCAs within Member States speculated that the use of the ISO standard is linked to industry pressure, which would be in violation of WHO FCTC guidelines<sup>531</sup>. The WHO itself reflected similar concerns around ISO standards, highlighting the influence that the industry exerts on ISO testing methods for tobacco and related products, particularly through technical committees. In response to the potential for the ISO testing method to result in \'misleadingly low levels of the measured compounds\', WHO established the WHO Tobacco Laboratory Network to develop improved methods for measuring emissions<sup>532</sup>. There is, however, international consensus, that none of the currently used TNCO measurement methods adequately reflect real smoking behaviour, nor is there any guidance or recommendation on which method to use.",

A key driver of the administrative costs related to the salaries of staff necessary to ensure implementation and enforcement. The available information on costs and benefits pertaining to compliance and enforcement suggests that their level as well as their composition vary across Member States.

Figure 26 demonstrates that the EU tobacco market consists mostly of sales of cigarettes, which in 2019 contributed EUR124.5 billion to the EUR156 billion market. This is significantly more than any other product category, with other tobacco products for smoking being the second largest contributor with a retail value of EUR17.5 billion in 2019. Sales for cigarettes, despite decreasing between 2015-16, have remained relatively stable. This trend was also reflected by the market for tobacco and related products as a whole.",

In 2013, 85% of the retail value of the tobacco market came from the sale of cigarettes. Other tobacco products for smoking were the second largest contributor, with a share of 10%. In 2013, e-vapour products constituted only 1% of the retail value of the market, and heated tobacco products 0%. In 2019, the market share of cigarettes decreased by five percentage points to 80%. This change can be attributed mostly to the growth of e-vapour products and heated tobacco products to , which respectively increased to 4% and 2%.

      text: "Figure 31 describes the composition of the market for heated tobacco products. Tobacco heated devices are any piece of technology or equipment which allow the consumer to heat rather than combust a tobacco product, and heated tobacco refers to the consumable element of tobacco vapour products (i.e. tobacco pods). In 2013 73% of the retail value of the market was generated by tobacco heated devices, whilst the remaining 27% was generated by heated tobacco. By contrast, in 2019 91% of retail value came from heated tobacco, and 9% from tobacco heated devices. This can be explained by the fact that tobacco heated devices can be considered as a one-off sunk cost for those using heating tobacco products, which does not need to be replaced frequently. Heated tobacco on the other hand includes the pods necessary to use tobacco heated devices and need to be purchased regularly. Therefore, this change in market composition is indicative of heated tobacco products becoming more established amongst tobacco users, as those who are using heated tobacco products have already purchased tobacco heating devices.",

This indicates that the purchase of cigarettes is going down in the majority of EU countries, with any observed rise in the retail value of cigarettes being due to increases in the price of cigarettes rather than volume. The largest decreases in retail volume over the period were observed in Ireland (-22%), the UK (-28%), and Greece (-36%).",

The market for moist snuff experienced rapid growth in Czechia, increasing by 427% in retail volume. Slovakia experienced similarly high growth for moist snuff, with a 328% increase in retail volume. In Sweden, where the majority of the market for most snuff is located (see Table 60), retail volume increased by only 11%.",

Estonia was the only Member State to experience a decrease in the prevalence of e-vapour products over the period (see Table 62), whilst the proportions in Sweden and France remained constant. The largest increase in the prevalence of e-vapour products was observed in the UK, where the proportion rose by 2.8 percentage points. Relative to e-vapour products, the prevalence of heated tobacco products is still lower in the majority of countries.",

This was done by calculating the growth in sales volumes for the different tobacco products from 2015-2019. The table below presents the products that met this criterion:",

The comparison of the changes in retail value and retail volume of these products in Table 52 and Table 53 show that although retail value for both cigars and cigarillos increased between 2013 and 2019, retail volume fell.",

Pipe tobacco experienced an increase in sales volume of 88% between 2013-18. The market share for heated tobacco products in 2019 was around 2%. As a result of this, it remains to be seen whether heated tobacco would reach in 2020 the 2.5% market share (in retail volume) threshold in order to trigger a substantial change in circumstances. However, given that heated tobacco products are a relatively new addition to the market and their generally lower taxation level, it is possible that in this case, retail value could act as an underestimate of their standing in the market relative to other products.",

It is also used for the collection of product submissions on e- cigarettes as required by Art. 20, and herbal products for smoking by Art. 22. National authorities can access these data via the Member States Reporting Tool (MS-REP). The aim of the EU-CEG system is to reduce administrative burden for economic operators and regulators and to allow Member States to retrieve, analyse, and compare product data. However, although the submission system is centralised, the responsibility for collecting and controlling data lies with each Member State, although they do have the possibility to store data submitted to them at Commission facilities.",

We consider a scenario in which an EU agency is tasked with all technical aspects of the submission, publication, and assessment of product and additive reports, collecting its own fees at the EU level and building the necessary technical expertise with specialised staff. This would transfer many of the data collection, analysis and publication requirements from the Member States to the EU level, including the implementation and maintenance of a database of ingredients, emissions, and additives.

As discussed above, there is variation between Member States in terms of the resources available for activities related to regulation of ingredients in tobacco products, not just in terms of analysing data submitted to EU-CEG, but also in terms of enforcement (See case study 4 on monitoring and enforcement). Therefore, any EU system would need to accommodate the differing capacity and capability of the Member States, as well as meeting their individual needs regarding the regulation of ingredients and emissions for tobacco products. In our gap-filling workshop, a few Member States expressed concern that moving from the current system to a completely centralised EU-level system could result in duplication of effort if national-level databases need to be maintained to meet Member State needs<sup>639</sup>.",

Implementing an EU-level system would therefore necessitate even greater harmonisation across Member States than has already been achieved. However, although greater harmonisation achieved via an EU-level system would address the concerns raised by economic operators regarding administrative burden, they may not always view it as the optimal solution.

However, despite this lack of conclusive evidence, some sources have attributed Finland\'s success in lowering smoking rates, while also keeping e- cigarette use to just 1% of the population, to their strict e-cigarette flavour ban.",

In particular, Denmark is currently in the process of implementing a ban, while legislation including a ban is due to be considered in Lithuania during 2021, and the Netherlands has opened a consultation for potential legislation around e-cigarette flavours. However, Member States that have implemented e-cigarette flavour bans have faced substantial challenges, particularly around companies selling liquids that can be used in e-cigarettes at times circumventing bans by portraying them as foodstuff. Additionally, Member States have limited capacity to keep up with the large number of e-cigarettes that are notified to them. An EU-wide e-cigarette flavour ban would potentially help address some of these challenges.",

All of these appeals dealt with whether the flavouring products sold by e-cigarette shops actually corresponded with the description of banned products in Finland\'s Tobacco Act 2016, in which the language of the Act banned flavoured liquids for e-cigarettes. All appeals argued that the language of the Tobacco Act was imprecise and was inaccurately interpreted by municipalities that had demanded that e-cigarette shops remove flavours from their stores. One law firm argued that the Tobacco Act did not prohibit flavours in liquids that could be used in e-cigarettes after being mixed with other liquids, and the other argued that Act did not prohibit flavours in liquids that could potentially be used for mixing with e-liquids (only those which purpose was to be used in e-cigarettes). The latter argued that the flavours in question were imported, produced and labelled as foodstuff, and provided leaflets that were in the e-cigarette shop describing how flavours could be used for drinks or baking as evidence. Court appeals around the e-cigarettes\' flavour ban also argued that municipalities had discriminated against e-cigarette shops, since grocery stores and other vendors could sell similar products.",

For example, according to the 2020 Eurobarometer survey, 14% of respondents from Finland reported ever having tried e-cigarettes, as compared to 25% in Estonia<sup>680</sup>. However, it is unclear whether Member State specific e-cigarette regulations, or flavour bans in particular, play a role in differences between countries. Data from the EU-CEG also do not conclusively demonstrate that banning e- cigarette flavours reduces the number of e-cigarette refill containers on the market. The number of e-liquid refill containers registered for Estonia in EU-CEG is approximately the average for all Members States, but for Finland the number is below the average. However, other Member States that did not have e-cigarette flavour bans in place at the time these data were collected also have low numbers of e-liquid refill containers being notified similar to Finland (e.g. Latvia, Denmark). Based on data from the 2020 Eurobarometer survey, Latvia and Denmark both have higher rates of e-cigarette use than Finland (21% and 17%, respectively, reported ever having tried e-cigarettes)<sup>681</sup>. However, as there is no straightforward way to translate prevalence of e-cigarette use for a Member State into an expected number of refill containers notified through the EU-CEG system for that Member State, it is unclear whether these EU-CEG data indicate a deviation from what would be expected given the level of use.",

However, some sources have attributed Finland\'s success in lowering smoking rates while also keeping e-cigarette use to just 1% of the population to their strict e-cigarette flavour ban. The implementation of the ban in Finland also highlights potential challenges that may be encountered by other Members States in implementing and enforcing these bans, namely the range of products and resources needed for enforcement, and the potential for e-cigarette companies to circumvent legislation so flavoured products remain available to consumers.",

However, improvements could be made to the technological system itself, and an EU-wide database containing information about products could potentially increase communication and reduce workload amongst NCAs. Another example is that Member States may not have fully applied the provisions on TNCO laboratories, as they lacked resources to appoint approved labs which would be independent from industry (Art. 4).",

We summarise the information for Member States currently without formal proposals in place (Section 0), those that are considering, or have considered, plain packaging (Section 0), and those that have recently adopted plain packaging (Section 0) and those that have had it in place for a number of years (Section 0).",

      text: "The main impediment to implementing plain packaging policy in the UK was the opposition of tobacco companies through legal challenges and various tactics to exploit loopholes in the legislation to delay and undermine the policy<sup>784</sup>. There have been several implementation challenges to plain packaging both before and after introduction of plain packaging. One challenge related to exploitation by tobacco companies of the transition period, which in the UK was longer (12 months) than for other countries, e.g. France (9 months)<sup>785</sup>. Tobacco companies delayed the introduction of standardised products and removal of fully branded packaging during the transition period, which may have mitigated some of the immediate intended effects of the legislation by desensitising consumers to plain packaging<sup>786</sup>. In addition, tobacco companies also exploited the transition period by introducing new pack, brand and product aspects<sup>787</sup>. Post-implementation, although compliance was generally high, market surveillance and commercial sales data revealed that there were cases of non- compliance with the legislation; with tobacco companies made adaptations and introduced innovations to tobacco products to enable brand differentiation (e.g. slim packets were on sale and changes to variant name) after plain packaging was fully implemented<sup>788,789,790</sup>. Tobacco companies have also capitalised on gaps in the legislation, for example by introducing new menthol-flavoured cigarillos, which are exempt from plain packaging legislation regarding controls on branding, price marking, and packet sizing; minimum excise tax; and the characterising flavour ban<sup>791</sup>.",

A review of internal tobacco industry documents, government documents and media sources indicates that, in all Member States, industry has employed a multipronged strategy throughout the progression of plain packaging policy<sup> 809</sup>. Although this strategy is tailored towards each domestic context, the overall tobacco industry\'s strategy remains consistently focused on shifting the attention away from public health, and framing plain packaging as an attack on trade and investment<sup>810</sup>. In addition, tobacco companies have argued that plain packaging is a dispute about human rights, EU law or investment law<sup>811</sup>. For example, in the UK, tobacco company claimants raised arguments involving the law of evidence, domestic and European constitutional law, human rights law, European and international intellectual property rules and the rules of the internal market<sup>812</sup>. None of the challenges to the legislation advanced by the industry were successful; the High Court ruled that intellectual property rights must always be subject to implicit normative limitations in the public interest<sup>813</sup>.

A set of retailers were selected from 11 Member States (see below) and a set of 46 scenarios developed in which the shopper was based in an EU country other than that of the retailer. The scenarios varied in terms of whether they shopper posed as someone above or below the legal age for purchasing tobacco or E-cigarette products. In all cases, the shopper selected an item for purchase and in a subset of the scenarios, completed the purchase (including payment and delivery) to determine what, if any, age verification checks were in place throughout the full purchasing process. The approach is summarised below, with the questionnaire used by researchers presented following the conclusions.",

Passed in May 2017, the new legislation is considered one of the strongest tobacco-control laws in the WHO European Region. This next-generation tobacco-control law includes the implementation of prohibition on smoking (including e-cigarettes and hookah) in all enclosed public places, enclosed workplaces and public vehicles. Recently conducted surveys reported high levels of knowledge of smoke-free regulations among the population (94%), with 85% of respondents approving these provisions. Compliance rates were also high for the smoke-free regulations (95% in general, including 97% in cafes and restaurants) (5,6,7).",

The Directive also sets minimum dimensions for warnings and therefore prohibits small packages for certain tobacco products. It bans promotional and misleading elements on tobacco products, e-cigarettes and herbal products for smoking. Two implementing decisions on the layout, design and shape of the combined health warnings for tobacco products for smoking and the position of the general warning, and the information message on roll-your-own tobacco marketed in pouches, have been adopted (2,10,11).",

It was launched in 2012, with the aim of offering free support and resources for those looking to stop smoking, including through medications, apps, social media groups and personal support from local health services. A comprehensive evaluation of Stoptober is conducted each year. The results of the 2017 campaign were largely positive and showed that it continues to play an important role in motivating and supporting smokers to quit, with 16% of smokers reporting making a quit attempt and 8% reporting they were still smoke-free at the end of October (12).",

The prohibition applies to tobacco, tobacco products and smoking accessories, including pipes, hookahs, cigarette paper and lighters. A total ban on the demonstration of tobacco products and the process of tobacco consumption was introduced for audiovisual materials created and intended for children. Where adult audiovisual material demonstrates tobacco products or the consumption process, the broadcaster is obliged to provide public announcements about the dangers of tobacco use immediately before or during the programme. According to evaluations conducted after the introduction of the ban, the proportion of adolescents who saw smoking on TV, in videos or other audiovisual formats had decreased by 10% since 2004. The ban on advertising of tobacco products is supported by the general public, with 80% population approval (13,14).",

      text: "Ukraine: on 7 December 2017, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a policy on increasing tobacco taxes for the coming seven years, until 2024. The national plan stipulates that the specific tobacco tax and minimum excise tax per 1 000 cigarettes will increase by 29.7% in 2018, and that tobacco taxes will increase by 20% annually over the next six years. The Government also retains the option of proposing an inflation adjustment annually. The aim of this policy change is to harmonize tobacco tax rates with the minimum EU level of taxation, which is EUR90 per 1 000 cigarettes. Ukraine\'s experience of increasing tobacco taxes has been positive. The average rate of excise duty on a pack of cigarettes increased by 20 times between 2008 and 2017, and state budget revenues increased from 3.5 billion hryvnias (US$ 124 million) to the projected 40 billion hryvnias (US$1 415 million) in 2017 (15).",
